## Introduction

### What is this app about?
This app is a Movie and TV series tracker, you can search your favorite movies or TV shows and add it to your list and always be aware of which movies or TV series you are currently watching, which ones you want to watch, and know which movies or series you have already finished.



### How does it work?
* You need to create a new user or login with a user already created. I provide a user and password if you want it:
```bash
user:   guest
pass:   asdfqwer
```
